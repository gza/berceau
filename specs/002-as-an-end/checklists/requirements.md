## Notes

**Validation Results (2025-10-21)**: All quality checks passed with Prisma context applied.

### Special Context for This Feature

This specification includes **Prisma as an explicit technology choice** because:

1. **Target audience is developers**: Unlike typical business-facing specs, this feature's users are component developers who need to know the exact tools they'll work with
2. **Prisma is part of the developer experience**: Developers will:
   - Write Prisma schema files
   - Use generated Prisma Client
   - Run Prisma migration commands
   - Work with Prisma's type system
3. **Technology choice affects workflow**: The decision to use Prisma (vs. other ORMs) is a key aspect of the feature design that developers need to understand

### Content Quality Assessment (Updated)

✅ **Appropriate technology specificity**: The specification now correctly identifies Prisma where developers will directly interact with it:
- User Story 1: "Prisma schema language"
- User Story 2: "Prisma Client" with "TypeScript types" and "IDE auto-completion"
- User Story 3: "Prisma migration CLI" and "Prisma's Data Model (DMMF)"
- User Story 4: "Prisma's seeding capabilities"
- User Story 5: "Prisma Client for testing"

✅ **Developer-focused language**: The specification uses developer-appropriate terminology while remaining clear about user value:
- "type-safe, auto-completed methods"
- "full TypeScript support"
- "IDE auto-completion"
- "Prisma schema language"

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections remain complete with Prisma context integrated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment (Updated)

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

✅ **Testable requirements with Prisma**: Each functional requirement is testable with Prisma-specific details:
- FR-001: "define database schemas using Prisma schema language"
- FR-003: "generate a Prisma Client for each component"
- FR-007: "using Prisma's migration tracking mechanisms"
- FR-013: "validate Prisma schema definitions for syntax errors"

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria maintain measurability with Prisma context:
- SC-001: "Prisma schema and access it through a generated Prisma Client"
- SC-002: "Prisma schema discovery and client generation in under 30 seconds"
- SC-003: "100% of defined Prisma migrations execute successfully"

✅ **Acceptance scenarios with Prisma**: Each scenario now includes Prisma-specific details where relevant:
- User Story 1, Scenario 1: "Prisma schema file"
- User Story 2, Scenario 1: "Prisma Client is generated that reflects the schema structure with full TypeScript types"
- User Story 3, Scenario 1: "Prisma migration CLI"

✅ **Edge cases updated**: Edge cases now reference Prisma where appropriate:
- "What happens when a component's Prisma schema conflicts..."
- "How does the system handle Prisma schema migrations that fail..."
- "What happens when the Prisma migration CLI is interrupted..."

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions with Prisma**: The Assumptions section now includes Prisma-specific context:
- "The database system is PostgreSQL (Prisma's fully-supported database)"
- "Prisma migration patterns (versioned migrations, migration history tracking via `_prisma_migrations` table)"
- "Components follow a standard directory structure where Prisma schema files can be predictably located (e.g., `component/prisma/schema.prisma`)"
- "Developers are familiar with Prisma schema language"
- "The TypeScript compiler is configured to handle generated Prisma Client types"

### Key Entities Updated

✅ **Prisma-specific entities**: Key entities now accurately reflect Prisma concepts:
- **Prisma Schema**: "using Prisma schema language", "model definitions", "datasource configuration"
- **Prisma Client**: "TypeScript code artifact", "full IntelliSense support"
- **Prisma Migration**: "using Prisma Migrate", "SQL operations", "migration history tracking"
- **Seed Data**: "utilizes Prisma Client for data insertion with full type safety"
- **Migration History**: "managed by Prisma's `_prisma_migrations` table"

---

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR NEXT PHASE

This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` as all quality validation items have passed with appropriate Prisma context for a developer-facing feature.
- FR-002: "System MUST discover and collect all schema definitions" - can be tested by checking if all schemas are found
- FR-013: "System MUST validate schema definitions for syntax errors" - can be tested with invalid schemas

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "zero manual configuration steps"
- SC-002: "under 30 seconds for projects with up to 20 components"
- SC-003: "100% of defined migrations execute successfully"
- SC-004: "isolated data that does not affect other running tests"
- SC-005: "with actionable error messages"
- SC-006: "within one build cycle"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: All success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes without mentioning implementation technologies. They describe what developers experience, not how it's built.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of the 5 user stories includes multiple Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios that are specific and testable.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 8 concrete edge cases are listed covering schema conflicts, migration failures, credential issues, component removal, transactions, build interruption, and constraint violations.

✅ **Scope clearly bounded**: The specification clearly defines what's in scope (component-level schemas, automatic client generation, migration execution, seeding, test access) with prioritized user stories (P1-P5) showing what's core vs. convenience features.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: The Assumptions section comprehensively identifies 9 dependencies including database system capabilities, component directory structure, permissions, and test framework support.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: While acceptance criteria are in the User Stories section rather than inline with each FR (which is acceptable given the template structure), each requirement maps clearly to testable scenarios. For example:
- FR-001 (define schemas) → User Story 1, Scenario 1
- FR-005 (execute migrations) → User Story 3, Scenarios 1-4
- FR-011 (test database access) → User Story 5, Scenarios 1-3

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User stories cover the complete developer workflow from P1 (schema definition) through P5 (testing), with each story representing an independent, testable capability.

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Each success criterion directly relates to the functional requirements and user stories, providing clear validation targets.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The specification maintains abstraction throughout, avoiding specific technology mentions while remaining concrete about capabilities and outcomes.

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR NEXT PHASE

This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` as all quality validation items have passed.
