# Implementation Plan: Component-Level Database Integration

**Branch**: `002-as-an-end` | **Date**: 2025-10-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-as-an-end/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. Refer to `.github/prompts/speckit.plan.prompt.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature enables component developers to define database schemas using Prisma schema files within their component directories. During the build process, all component schemas are collected into a central `prisma/schema/` directory, leveraging Prisma's native multi-file schema support (GA since v6.7.0). A single centralized Prisma Client is generated from all schemas, providing type-safe database access to all models from all components. Developers use standard Prisma CLI commands for migrations, with manual migration execution required in development before starting the dev server.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9 / Node.js (NestJS 11)  
**Primary Dependencies**: NestJS (modules, controllers, dependency injection, providers), Prisma ORM v6.7.0+, Webpack 5 (for build integration), Jest (tests)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM, using DATABASE_URL environment variable)  
**Testing**: Jest (unit + integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: Linux server (Node.js runtime)  
**Project Type**: Single monolithic web application with component-based architecture  
**Performance Goals**: Build-time schema discovery and compilation; runtime database access via standard Prisma Client (no additional overhead)  
**Constraints**: Must use Prisma v6.7.0+ for multi-file schema support; requires PostgreSQL; component schemas must be self-contained (models/enums only)  
**Scale/Scope**: Multiple components (10-50 expected), each with 0-20 database models; centralized schema in `prisma/schema/` directory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Service-Oriented Architecture**: âœ… PASS  
- This feature provides a build-time service (schema discovery & compilation) that components consume via the centralized Prisma Client
- The Prisma Client is a well-documented TypeScript API that components import and use
- No violation of service boundaries

**II. UI Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with JSX**: âœ… PASS  
- This feature is infrastructure-level (database access layer)
- Does not affect SSR implementation
- No conflict

**III. Component-Hosting Platform**: âœ… PASS  
- This feature directly supports the platform's goal of providing a reliable, well-documented environment for third-party components
- Components get type-safe database access through standard Prisma patterns
- Clear documentation will be provided in demo component

**IV. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: âœ… PASS  
- Build process changes will be tested (schema discovery, copying, generation)
- Integration tests will verify Prisma Client usage in components
- Demo component will include test examples

**V. Security by Design**: âœ… PASS  
- Database credentials via environment variables (twelve-factor app pattern)
- No credential exposure in component code
- Prisma provides SQL injection protection
- Connection string security is delegated to standard Prisma practices

**Overall Assessment**: No constitution violations. All principles are respected.

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure is appropriate. This is a build-time infrastructure feature that integrates with the existing NestJS monolith. The `prisma/` directory at project root follows standard Prisma conventions. Component schemas are co-located with components in `src/components/*/prisma/schema.prisma`. The build process copies schemas to `prisma/schema/` and generates a single client.
