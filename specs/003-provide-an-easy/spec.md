# Feature Specification: CSRF Token Protection for UI Forms

**Feature Branch**: `003-provide-an-easy`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "provide an easy way to protect posts from UI by CSRF token"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Programmatic Token Access for JavaScript (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to access the CSRF token value programmatically in JavaScript code (e.g., for AJAX calls, dynamic form generation, passing to JavaScript functions, or in automated tests).

**Why this priority**: Essential for comprehensive automated testing of CSRF protection. Also enables dynamic interactions and API calls that require CSRF protection.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by retrieving the token programmatically in JavaScript and using it in an AJAX request or passing it to a JavaScript function.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a JSX component needs to expose the token to client-side JavaScript, **When** the developer uses a token accessor function or component prop, **Then** the token value is available in the rendered JavaScript context
2. **Given** client-side JavaScript needs to make an authenticated POST request, **When** the code retrieves the CSRF token programmatically, **Then** it can include the token in the request headers or body
3. **Given** a developer needs the token parameter name, **When** they access the token metadata, **Then** both the token value and parameter name are available

---

### User Story 2 - Server-Side Validation (Priority: P1)

The system automatically validates CSRF tokens on all state-changing HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) without explicit controller code.

**Why this priority**: Essential security - automatic validation prevents developers from forgetting to validate tokens.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending various HTTP requests with different token states and verifying automatic validation behavior. Programmatic token access (US1) simplifies test implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a POST endpoint, **When** a request is received with a valid CSRF token, **Then** the request is processed normally
2. **Given** a POST endpoint, **When** a request is received without a CSRF token, **Then** the request is rejected with 403 Forbidden
3. **Given** a POST endpoint, **When** a request is received with a token from an expired session, **Then** the request is rejected with 403 Forbidden
4. **Given** a GET/HEAD/OPTIONS endpoint, **When** a request is received without a CSRF token, **Then** the request is processed normally (read-only operations are exempt)

---

### User Story 3 - Developer Adds CSRF Protection to Forms (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to protect form submissions (POST, PUT, DELETE) from CSRF attacks by easily adding CSRF tokens to their JSX-rendered forms using a simple component import.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - protecting forms from CSRF attacks is a critical security requirement for web applications, and it must be simple to implement correctly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a server-side rendered JSX form with CSRF protection, submitting it with and without valid tokens, and verifying proper acceptance/rejection. Depends on User Story 2 being implemented. Programmatic token access (US1) simplifies test implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates an HTML form in a JSX component, **When** they include the `<CsrfToken />` component from the CSRF protection library, **Then** a hidden input field with the CSRF token is automatically included in the rendered HTML
2. **Given** a form with CSRF protection, **When** a user submits the form with a valid token, **Then** the submission is processed successfully
3. **Given** a form with CSRF protection, **When** a user submits the form without a token or with an invalid token, **Then** the submission is rejected with a clear error message
4. **Given** multiple concurrent requests, **When** JSX forms are rendered, **Then** each request receives its own unique valid token

---

### User Story 4 - Flexible Opt-Out for APIs (Priority: P2)

API endpoints that don't handle HTML forms need a way to disable CSRF validation selectively.

**Why this priority**: Modern applications often mix form-based UIs with REST APIs; REST APIs typically use other authentication mechanisms.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring opt-out rules and verifying both form endpoints remain protected while API endpoints are exempt.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** configuration disables CSRF for non-form endpoints, **When** a JSON API endpoint receives a POST without CSRF token, **Then** the request is processed successfully
2. **Given** configuration disables CSRF for specific paths, **When** those endpoints receive requests without tokens, **Then** they are processed successfully
3. **Given** CSRF is disabled for certain endpoints, **When** form-based endpoints receive requests, **Then** they still require valid CSRF tokens

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user keeps a form open for an extended period and the session expires before submission?
- How does the system handle double-submit scenarios (user clicks submit twice)?
- What happens when CSRF protection is enabled mid-session for an already authenticated user?
- How are tokens handled in a multi-tab scenario where a user has multiple forms open?
- What happens if a developer accidentally disables CSRF for a form endpoint?
- What alternative authentication mechanisms should be used for endpoints that opt out of CSRF protection?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically generate unique CSRF tokens for each user session
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide programmatic access to CSRF token values and parameter names for JavaScript code and automated tests
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a `<CsrfToken />` JSX component that can be imported and used in forms
- **FR-004**: The `<CsrfToken />` component MUST render a hidden input field with the current CSRF token value and appropriate parameter name
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically validate CSRF tokens on all POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests that contain form data
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT require CSRF tokens for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
- **FR-007**: System MUST reject requests with missing, invalid, or session-expired CSRF tokens with HTTP 403 status
- **FR-008**: System MUST bind token lifetime to session lifetime (tokens expire when session expires)
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow developers to configure paths or content types that are exempt from CSRF validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when CSRF validation fails
- **FR-011**: System MUST use the Synchronizer Token Pattern (server-side token storage) as recommended by OWASP
- **FR-012**: System MUST store CSRF tokens server-side in the session and MUST NOT transmit tokens to the client except as hidden form fields in server-rendered HTML
- **FR-013**: System MUST be designed to mitigate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, specifically CSRF attacks
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide developer documentation warning that endpoints with disabled CSRF protection require alternative authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, JWT, API keys)

### Key Entities

- **CSRF Token**: Unique cryptographically secure string generated per session using the Synchronizer Token Pattern; stored server-side in session; includes token value and associated session identifier
- **Request Context**: Contains current request method, headers, parameters, and session information needed for validation
- **Configuration**: Application settings defining exempt paths, token lifetime (tied to session), parameter name, and validation rules

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can add CSRF protection to a form by using a single template tag without additional controller code
- **SC-002**: 100% of form submissions with valid CSRF tokens are accepted and processed
- **SC-003**: 100% of form submissions without valid CSRF tokens are rejected with appropriate error responses
- **SC-004**: CSRF token injection requires zero lines of configuration code for standard use cases
- **SC-005**: Documentation and examples enable a developer unfamiliar with CSRF to implement protection in under 10 minutes
- **SC-006**: System successfully prevents CSRF attacks as defined by OWASP CSRF testing scenarios
- **SC-007**: No measurable performance degradation (< 5ms added latency per request) when CSRF validation is enabled

## Assumptions *(optional)*

- The project uses server-side rendered JSX (React 19) for rendering HTML with no client-side JavaScript for form submissions
- The application follows RESTful principles with GET for reads and POST/PUT/DELETE for mutations
- Sessions are managed by the application framework (required for Synchronizer Token Pattern)
- The backend has session management and CSRF token storage capabilities

## Dependencies *(optional)*

- Depends on React 19 server-side rendering being properly configured
- Depends on server-side session management functionality (for storing CSRF tokens server-side)
- Depends on the ability to pass context data from controllers to JSX components
- Depends on HTTP-only session cookies for session management

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

- Authentication/authorization - CSRF protection is orthogonal to user authentication
- Protection for non-browser clients (native mobile apps) - assumes standard web browser usage
- Custom cryptographic token generation algorithms - uses framework defaults
- Rate limiting or brute-force protection - different security concern
- SameSite cookie configuration - handled by existing cookie management
- Migration of existing forms - developers must update templates manually
