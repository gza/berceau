## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

**Validation completed**: 2025-10-23

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

Minor notes:
- FR-002 and FR-003 mention specific template syntax (e.g., `inject:csrf.token`) which defines the interface but not implementation
- These interface definitions are necessary for clarity and don't constitute implementation details
- The spec successfully balances concreteness with technology-agnosticism
