# Specification Quality Checklist: Platform Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**All checklist items pass ✓**

### Content Quality Review
- ✓ Specification contains no framework-specific details (NestJS, React, etc.)
- ✓ All sections focus on what users need and business value
- ✓ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✓ All 13 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✓ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time limits, percentages, completion rates)
- ✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of databases, frameworks, etc.)
- ✓ 3 prioritized user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (admin bootstrap, magic link login, logout)
- ✓ 6 edge cases identified covering security, reliability, and user experience
- ✓ Scope is clearly bounded (magic links only, no OTP, no user management UI, no registration)
- ✓ Assumptions documented (15-minute token expiration uses industry standard)

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✓ Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- ✓ User scenarios cover all primary authentication flows (bootstrap, magic link, logout)
- ✓ Success criteria provide clear, measurable outcomes for feature validation
- ✓ No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: admin bootstrap, P2: magic link auth, P3: logout)
- Focused minimal scope (removed OTP to concentrate on core functionality)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Reasonable defaults documented (15min magic link expiration)
- Strong security focus (token invalidation, audit logging, no user enumeration)
