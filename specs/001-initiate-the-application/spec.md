## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, when I first visit the application, I want to see a welcome page and be able to navigate to an "About" page using a side menu, so that I can understand the application's purpose.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded at the root URL, **When** I view the page, **Then** I should see the content of the "Welcome" page.
2. **Given** I am on any page, **When** I look at the layout, **Then** I should see a left-hand navigation menu.
3. **Given** the left menu is visible, **When** I click the "Welcome" link, **Then** the "Welcome" page content is displayed.
4. **Given** the left menu is visible, **When** I click the "About" link, **Then** the "About" page content is displayed.
5. **Given** a user navigates to a URL that does not correspond to a page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a "404 Not Found" error page is displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to navigate to a non-existent page? A "404 Not Found" page MUST be displayed.
