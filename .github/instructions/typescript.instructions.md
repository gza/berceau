- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Avoid using semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line object and array literals.
- Include spaces inside curly braces.
- Keep lines of code under 100 characters.
- Always include parentheses around arrow function arguments.
- Avoid declaring unused variables.
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes and components.
- Group imports as third-party modules, local modules, and then styles or assets.
- Remove console statements before committing code.
- Use **strict TypeScript** configuration
- **ES modules** throughout (`"type": "module"`)
- **Interface over type** for object definitions
- For JSX-specific conventions, follow `.github/instructions/tsx.instructions.md`.
